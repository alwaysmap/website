## People First, Then the Machines

I'm Dylan Thomas, and I help tech companies run better.

The technology is hard enough, but if you're not solving a problem **for people, with people**, you're not doing it right.
That principle has guided my entire career from geospatial technology to leading operations at some of the world's biggest tech companies.

## What I've Built

<span class="brand-highlight"><strong>Operations at scale</strong></span> — I built customer success programs at **Google Maps**, built a consulting and engineering team from scratch at Woolpert, and led in GitHub's EPD operations as it scaled.
The lesson I learned: repeatable processes beat heroics every time.

<span class="brand-highlight"><strong>Programs that actually ship</strong></span> — I helped launch **Android Auto** into 70 million vehicles, coordinating dozens of teams across hardware partners and automotive timelines.
Complex programs don't have to feel chaotic.

<span class="brand-highlight"><strong>Teams that scale</strong></span> — At **GitHub**, I led the Technical Program Management team through major platform transitions, balancing velocity with reliability for millions of developers.
Good process enables speed rather than slowing it down.

<span class="brand-highlight"><strong>Consulting that works</strong></span> — I built **Woolpert's** cloud consulting practice from scratch and learned how to package expertise and deliver consistent value.
Professional services can scale if you set them up right.

## What I Do Now

I help tech companies with three things: fixing operations that are breaking as you scale; shipping complex programs and initiatives with clarity and honesty; and building teams that can deliver value.

I bring experience from Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and other companies where I've seen what works at scale and what doesn't.
